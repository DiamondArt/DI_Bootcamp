        <h3>About Domestic Cat</h3>
        <p>
            The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
            It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
            Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.
            Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
            About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

        <h3>Etymology and naming</h3>
        <p>
            The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.
            It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.
            The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language.
            The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.
            The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic.
        </p>
        <p>
            A male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered).
            An unspayed female is called a queen(or a molly if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding context.
            A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.
            A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.

        <h2>About Lion</h2>
        <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo), or lioness for females, is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
            A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
            The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
